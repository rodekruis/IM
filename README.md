IM Dashboard [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/), [Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) based application.
The idea is to build a scalable solution for small scale projects that require distributed datamanagement and data visualisation through maps (GIS).

## Before You Begin 
Before you begin we recommend you read about the basic building blocks that assemble a MEAN.JS application: 
* MongoDB - Go through [MongoDB Official Website](http://mongodb.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manual](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/), which should help you understand NoSQL and MongoDB better.
* Express - The best way to understand express is through its [Official Website](http://expressjs.com/), particularly [The Express Guide](http://expressjs.com/guide.html); you can also go through this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8144214/learning-express-for-node-js) for more resources.
* AngularJS - Angular's [Official Website](http://angularjs.org/) is a great starting point. You can also use [Thinkster Popular Guide](http://www.thinkster.io/), and the [Egghead Videos](https://egghead.io/).
* Node.js - Start by going through [Node.js Official Website](http://nodejs.org/) and this [StackOverflow Thread](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js), which should get you going with the Node.js platform in no time.


## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all these prerequisites on your development machine.
* Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](http://www.nodejs.org/download/) and the npm package manager, if you encounter any problems, you can also use this [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814) to install Node.js.
```
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ sudo apt-get install npm
```

* MongoDB - [Download & Install MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads), and make sure it's running on the default port (27017).
```
$ sudo apt-get install mongodb
```
sudo apt-get install mongodb
* Bower - You're going to use the [Bower Package Manager](http://bower.io/) to manage your front-end packages, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install bower globally using npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g bower
```

* Grunt - You're going to use the [Grunt Task Runner](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate your development process, in order to install it make sure you've installed Node.js and npm, then install grunt globally using npm:

```
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
```

## Getting Started With the Digidoc
Edit the config/secrets.json.template to set your project secrets and save it to config/secrets.json

Make sure the certificates mentioned in the secrets.json are located in the config/cert/

The apache service needs to be running, as it is serving as a proxy: sudo service apache2 start|stop|restart

The apache config files are located in /etc/apache2/sites-available/

The digidoc upstart script needs to be running, which will start the node server: sudo start|stop digidoc
The upstart script is located in /etc/init/digidoc.conf

## Debugging
If for whatever reason you need to debug on the production server, use this command:
sudo NODE_ENV="development" PATH=$PATH node-debug /var/www/digidoc/server.js

## Credits
Inspired by the great work of [Madhusudhan Srinivasa](https://github.com/madhums/)
The MEAN name was coined by [Valeri Karpov](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and)
